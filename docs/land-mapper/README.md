# Land Mapper

## Concept Brief

The Land Mapper feature is designed to provide users with an intuitive and interactive way to explore, map, and analyze land data using native Android capabilities. It aims to leverage device sensors, GPS, and mapping APIs to deliver a seamless experience for land surveying, property boundary identification, and geographic data visualization.

## Day-1 Plan

1. Set up the project structure for the Land Mapper feature.
2. Integrate basic map view using Google Maps or Mapbox SDK.
3. Implement GPS location tracking to show the user's current position on the map.
4. Add UI components for zooming, panning, and map type selection.
5. Research and plan for offline map capabilities and data caching.
6. Document the initial setup and usage instructions in the README.

This plan sets the foundation for further development and iteration of the Land Mapper feature.
